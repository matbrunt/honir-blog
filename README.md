Source code and content for my personal blog

A lot of the material here is amalgamated from various sources I have read during my studies, sometimes reworded to make it more understandable for myself.

Where possible I have tried to credit the original author, I have no intention of passing off other people's work as my own, but unfortunately I have not captured all the source links. If a passage seems familiar to you, and you know the originating source please contact me so I can update the creditation.
