I started this personal blog as a method of learning, by writing up my study notes it helps me retain the information better.

Once I started my journey from Engineering into Data Science I kept getting asked to recommend articles that I had read, or could I explain how a particular concept worked, so it seemed it could be useful to open my notes up in case they can help others.

Here you will find articles that I found helpful and interesting, and my attempts to explain concepts as I understand them.

I have always had an interest in finding answers amongst the noise. Coming from a varied career I have always believed in cross training over multiple disciplines as a way of building lots of applicable skills. My personal goal is to be proficient in a number of areas rather than highly specialised in one. I combine analytical and engineering skills to find the right questions to ask, design experiments, test hypotheses, and develop systems to meaningfully visualise and interpret the findings.

Using knowledge from Theory of Constraints, Critical Chain, Supply Chain Optimisation, Agile and Lean concepts, I blend my analytical and engineering skills to cover the full data science lifecycle, from initial requirements gathering to building models and the data pipeline, then finally deploying full stack data products.

I also have an interest in optimising the way we learn using ideas from cognitive science, and am experimenting with using virtual reality environments to aid mnemonic learning and recall.

Working in the following areas has given me exposure to a number of different environments, and I am fortunate to have made many varied friendships over the years.

- *Meta-search, combining and aggregating disparate sources of information*

- *eCommerce websites using purchasing patterns for product recommendations and traffic profiles*

- *Defence and Nuclear Industries*

- *Mobile tracking systems using positional information to build movement profiles*

- *Logistical systems for inventory management and supply chain optimisation*

- *Platform spiders that return data to a central ETL pipeline for shaping and analysis*

- *Network crawlers visualising an estates connectivity for security and penetration analysis*

- *Protocol analysis to identify attack signatures and data mining to gain target information*

I constantly work to improve and advance my personal interests in Machine Learning, Predictive Analytics, Statistics and Virtual Reality. If you are looking for someone to bridge the gap between Engineering and Data Science, and are eager to promote Data Science and Machine Learning techniques and learning then I would love to hear from you.

Hope you enjoy your time here!
