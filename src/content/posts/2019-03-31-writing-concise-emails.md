I type the way I talk, which results in my emails being overly verbose and hard to distinguish the signal I wish to convey amongst all the noise.

Do that enough times and I suspect normal human behaviour would be to no longer read lengthy emails and instead skim them, which means the message I'm trying to get across is no longer effective, and worse still, I am potentially wasting the time of every recipient.

To try and address this, I started reading various books and looked around to see how other people use email for meaningful communication; these are some of the ideas I came across.

## Keyworded Subject Line

With this short collection of words, you want to get across what the email is about (**it's purpose**) and also as important, what you want the recipient to do with it (**the action**). Using the subject line only, the recipient should be instantly able to prioritise when they look at the email body; is it something that requires action, a decision from them, or is it just information to keep them in the loop?

Use a leading keyword to denote your expected use of the email content:

- **ACTION**: This needs the recipient to do something with the email
- **APPROVAL**: This requires a signature or approval
- **DECISION**: You're blocked until the recipient makes a decision
- **INFO**: Informational purposes only, no response or action is required
    - This one is interesting - are there better ways of sending information than filling people's email folders up, maybe a Confluence page, blog post etc

*Example: "APPROVAL: Journal membership expense (28 Mar 2019)"*

## TLDR / Summary

The very first part of the email body should be a short, concise paragraph saying what the email is about, and what action will be required by the reader. Think of someone accessing the email on a phone, they should be able to decide whether to scroll down for the rest of the mail and keep reading with the information you provide at the top of the screen.

This section should briefly answer the five W's: **Who, What, Where, When, and Why**. More detail can be given if required lower down in the email.

*Example: "Journal membership due for renewal 28 Mar 2019, membership gives access to industry research. Cost review meeting 27 Mar 2019."*

### State Intent, Not Confusion

Everyone is busy, and have their own situations they are dealing with. Yet we are all helpful and if we can add input to help someone work through a scenario we appreciate being asked to be involved, even more so if you show that you have already thought through the problem yourself.

When asking for a decision or approval you probably know the details better than the recipients - to get to the stage of sending an email you will already have thought through different options, evaluated their strengths and weaknesses, and have a personal choice of what you would do.

So instead of laying out the full problem, then asking at the very end *"what do you think I should do"*, you can save a lot of time by stating at the beginning **"this is the situation, and this is what I intend to do about it"**. After that you can lay out your thought process and what you have considered - the difference in approaches is if the recipient agrees with your action, they are not forced to read any further. It is also a good training technique that forces you to think, after a few of these you may find you no longer need to ask for advice on well known problems and their solutions.

### Choose Your Delivery

Shorter emails are more effective than longer ones. People don't tend to open emails for the pleasure of reading (that's why we have books), we only open an email so we can make a decision what to do with the information suggested in the subject line. Reading too many long emails, trying to work out what you are expected to do with the content causes information fatigue and choosing the easiest action path, which in many cases is simply deleting the email if you abuse your recipients attention too many times (think of your reaction to some of the mailshots you receive).

Using long phrases and overly verbose language makes it harder to build the picture you are trying to describe, instead try to summarise information into shorter action-oriented phrases with bullet points replacing paragraphs.

Where possible, use an active rather than a passive voice. For example, *"It has been demonstrated through workplace studies that health related issues increase by working long hours whilst suffering the symptoms of stress"* can be shortened to a more concise sentence *"Research suggests working long hours and stress increases health issues"*.

If you need to reference additional information, link to the information rather than attach files - it is easier to update the information without sending more emails out, and if the material is sensitive, risk is reduced of accidentally giving the information to someone who shouldn't have access to it.

Also consider your choice of medium. If the content is overly technical or complex, is an email the best way to distribute? Would you be better where you have different concepts of content length and richer media tools, such as with a blog post, or sharing a Confluence document?

## Putting It All Together: An Example Email

Using the key points from above, a sample email could look like below:

> *Subject: APPROVAL - Publish new working directive (April 01)*
> 
> *Kate / Bob,*
> 
> *TLDR: Change to our working policy; effective April 01, to recognise employee engagement all staff can now work 4 day weeks at full pay, company t-shirts should be worn on day 5 to promote our culture.*
> 
> *All our employees are working hard, being productive and complete their contracted hours within 4 days of the week. To recognise their efforts and keep this level of productivity sustainable I intend to change our working directives and redistribute to all departments.*
> 
> *Context:*
> 
> - *Analysis shows increase in median productivity working in shorter, more focused bursts: (internal link)*
>     - *note: research accessible only through Corporate network*
> - *Industry research reflects these findings in the wider technology sector: (external link)*
> - *Each squad is expected to arrange full week cover amongst themselves*
> - *People team requested company t-shirts issued to all staff; expected increase in hiring applications from culture advertisement*
> - *If you want to follow up on this I'll be at the beach; bring a bucket*

> *Regards,*

> *A. Bright-Spark*

(and yes, this was deliberately made tongue in cheek)
