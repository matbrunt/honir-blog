# Six Types of Profit

When looking at an income statement, you should check that the change in profits over the years, is the same as or greater than the change in revenue (sales).

However there are six types of reported profit, some more useful than others for evaluating companies.

There are different terms for profit: *Income*, *earnings* and *profit* are all the same thing.

## Gross Profits

*Sales less than the cost to produce the goods sold*.

i.e. the profits from selling a product or service, less the cost of making it, such as raw materials, rents, wages, marketing etc.

- Rarely useful as companies differ in how they account for 'costs' of producing something, even within the same industry

- As long as the company doesn't change how it calculates gross profits year to year, looking at the trend might be helpful

If the gross profit growth rate increases faster than the sales growth, then the gao between what it costs to make a product, and what the business is selling it for is increasing.

## Trading (Operating) Profits

One of the best ways to measure how good or bad a company is.

*Profits the business makes from trading*.

`Trading Profits = Sales - "Costs to sell the goods' - "Other costs (e.g. depreciation on plant and machinery, admin costs)"`.

- Operating profit is more reliable than gross profit

- Says how much money is left over after all a company's expenses are taken away from sales

- Allows YoY comparison within the business, and comparison with other companies

- Not affected by how much debt a company has (which impacts the business through the interest payable on the debt)

- Not affected by the rate of tax a business pays

## Profit Before Interest and Tax (EBIT)

The best profit number to use when analysis a company.

Also known as 'Earnings Before Interest and Tax'.

*Similar to Trading Profit, but also includes profits from other business not wholly owned by the company (associations or joint ventures)*.

A measure of how good the managers are at making money from the company's assets.

EBIT is measured after all a company's operating costs have been expensed, but before considering financing expenses such as debt interest payments and tax.

- Gives a comparable measure of company effectiveness at turning business operations into money

- Companies have different debt and tax structures which impact the amount of money a business has, so this measure is only looking at how well they make profit (not how well they get to use that profit)

Example:

Two business make an EBIT of £10K, but one has no debt, and the other is mainly just debt financed.

The latter will show a better return on equity (Profit / Equity) as they made a larger proportion of profit based on the equity they put into the business (as the debt financing made up the rest of the business operations).

However the underlying truth is that both businesses actually did as well as each other in making profit - they both had an EBIT of 10K. One business made that level of profit with no debt, so EBIT is a much fairer comparison.

|Income Statement (£)|Alpha|Bravo|
|:===|===:|===:|
|EBIT (A)|10,000|10,000|
|Interest @ 5%|0|(4750)|
|Profit Before Tax|10,000|5250|
|Tax @ 20%|(2000)|(1050)|
|Profit for the year (B)|8000|4200|
|Value of assets (C)|100,000|100,000|
|Debt|0|95,000|
|Equity (D)|100,000|5000|
|Total Invested (equity + debt)|100,000|100,000|
|Return on assets (A/C)|10%|10%|
|Return on equity (B/D)|8%|84%|

## Profit Before Tax (PBT)

*Company's EBIT plus income interest made, less debt interest paid*.


Not as useful as EBIT because it is affected by how much debt a business has (and the interest expense associated with that debt).

Using the example above, the debt financed company has a much lower Profit Before Tax than the company with no debt.

- Interest paid on debt is known as net interest.

- Lower interest bills are better than higher ones, as more of the trading profits are available to the shareholders

## Profit After Tax (PAT)

*The company's Profit Before Tax less the tax expense*.

Which country the profits are made in, and the tax structure in the business, all have an impact on the amount of tax the company pays.

You should calculate the company's effective tax rate (the amount it actually pays) by dividing the tax expense by the pre-tax profit: `Effective Tax Rate = Taxation / Profit Before Tax`.

- Company's have different tax structures, so comparing companies on their PAT is difficult.

- One thing to look for is compare the growth in Profits After Tax, with the increase in the tax bill
    - Do the profits increase more than the tax bill did, e.g. 20% profit increase, but 8% tax bill increase

- If a company has taxable profits outside the UK, it pays a different tax rate on them

- Very few companies pay exactly the statutory rate of Corporation Tax on their pre-tax profits

- Be wary of companies with low effective tax rates
    - (because the reason for keeping them low may not last forever, meaning their tax bill will go up)

- If the effective tax rate is lower than the statutory rate, you will usually find a comment on why in the financial directors review in the company's annual report

- Deferred taxes don't have to be paid immediately, so the number reported in the income statement, might not match the amount of cash handed to HMRC in the cash flow statement

- Where *"Profit After Tax from Continuing Activities"* is mentioned, this number only includes the businesses the company is continuing to operate moving forward
    - i.e. it excludes businesses that have been sold or closed during the year
    - it also gives a better way of judging the company's progress in future years

### Taxable Profits Are Different Betweeen Investors and HMRC

Profits Before Tax reported to investors can differ between the values reported to investors, and reported to HMRC, because of the tax treatment of various expenses.

- Some expenses are not deductible for tax purposes, meaning HMRC consider them in the taxable profits

- Some expenses get favorable tax treatment, such as capital investment on new plant and equipment, so HMRC don't consider the full amount in taxable profits

### Trading Exclusively in the UK

There's a rough rule of thumb for companies that trade exclusively in the UK:

- If the effective tax rate is greater than the statutory Corporation Tax rate
    - HMRC regards the company's profits higher than those reported to investors

- If the effective rax rate is lower than the statutory Corporation Tax rate
    - HMRC regards the company's profits to be lower than those reported to investors

## Earnings Per Share (EPS)

*Company's Profit After Tax, less profits marked for minority interests and preferred shareholders, divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue through the year*.

**Not a good measure of company performance**.

- One of the most abused ratios in financial analysis

- Can be calculated in a myriad of ways, just to confuse investors

- Rising EPS does not mean a good company
    - it can be boosted by shrinking the number of shares in issue by buying back its own shares
    - this is at the expense of growing profits

If you have to look at EPS, then use *diluted EPS*.

Diluted EPS is the impact on EPS caused by additional shares being issued in the future, such as share options, share bonuses or debt that converts to shares.
