This summer I spent a wonderfully relaxed time by a pool reading Cal Newports 'Deep Work: rules for focused success in a distracted world'. He has also published a nice post about the [effectiveness of Rhodes scholars](http://calnewport.com/blog/2011/03/20/how-to-become-a-rhodes-scholar-decoding-the-accomplishments-of-elite-students/).

Reading that post gave me a couple of thoughts that I'm capturing here to remind myself every time I get bogged down with a task, or start feeling that I'm not making any progress.

*Become a minimalist*. Find the thing you want to achieve next and focus on it. Invest your extracurricular energies on that thing, and *commit to do less to achieve more*.

That last part I think needs to be called out again to reinforce the message: **"Commit to do less, to achieve more"**.

Instead of saying *"I should be doing more"*, promise yourself *"I should be doing less"*.

This pattern according to Cal Newport is very common amongst elite students - they do very little, but do what they do very well.

Don't get to your next milestone and look back saying, "I could have done better, but I didn't make enough time to actually be good at something that mattered to me.".
