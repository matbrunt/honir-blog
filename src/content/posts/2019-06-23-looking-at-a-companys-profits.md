# Looking At A Company's EBIT

Look at the last ten years EBIT, to account for different stages of the company's economic cycle - get a feel for performance in good times and bad times.

- Where possible, use normalised EBIT for a more accurate measure of the underlying true profitability

- Has the company been growing its sales and profits (EBIT) over the last ten years?

- Plot sales and profits; is the growth in profits coming from selling more?

- EBIT can show growth by cutting costs rather than growing sales
	- only a temporary improvement however, eventually you run out of things to cut
	- this is a poor long-term source of profit growth

- Avoid companies that growth mainly by cutting costs

## Normalised EBIT

*This ignores any exceptional gains and costs, as they are not expected to occur every year*.

- Companies can abuse exceptional items, saying they are one-off where in reality they occur most years
	- They do this to boost their normalised profits (EBIT)

- Example of abuses are redundancy costs, they can list significant exceptional costs each year
	- This results in a big gap between reported and normalised profits
	- Is a sign of aggresive accounting; stay away from companies like this

- Be wary of companies with regular one-off expenses, and where normalised EBIT is always significantly higher than total EBIT

- Plot EBIT and Normalised EBIT numbers; it is a good sign if they are fairly close together over time
