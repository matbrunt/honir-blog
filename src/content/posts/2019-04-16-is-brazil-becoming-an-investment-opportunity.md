I read the news mainly for pleasure, catching up on what is happening around the Globe and exposing myself to differing viewpoints. Every now and then it proves useful; whilst doing some analysis today I came across what looked like a change in the data held on Brazil, which sparked a memory connection with a recent article in the Financial Times suggesting the Brazilian economy is starting to show a recovery.

This post is primarily just capturing initial notes and thoughts from the source article, as a placeholder and reminder to investigate further. Once I find time for research I will expand and reformat this article to be more focused, or link to further content.
