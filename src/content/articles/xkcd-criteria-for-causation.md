**Hill's criteria for causation** by Sir Austin Bradford Hill is a set of guidelines for establishing whether there is evidence of a causal relationship. It sets out aspects of associations that should be considered when thinking about causality.

I stumbled across this post by [Lucy D'Agostino McGowan](http://livefreeordichotomize.com/2016/12/15/hill-for-the-data-scientist-an-xkcd-story/) whilst looking for something else but I think it is brilliant, it describes the underlying concepts in a really easy to understand manner. Using XKCD comics to highlight some of the points as well is an ingenious idea, a lot of the reading I have been doing recently is on mnemonic learning and recall, using comic strips might prove to be a very easy to remember hook to each concept.

I have linked some of my particular favourites that I've seen on many different sites below:
