A summary of the Financial Times article '[The secret life of an armchair trader](https://www.ft.com/content/b59ea0f0-4661-11e9-b83b-0c525dad548f)'.

Personally I'm sceptical, it has the feel of a paid advertising piece. It all sounds a little too idealised, and without substance. Like he's trying to sell a story or self-image that he believes, or as one comment suggested, testing the water to write a book.

That said, if all the content is true and is down to acquired knowledge rather than fortune, then I am very happy he enjoys what he does, and it works well enough to make a living from.

## History

- Started trading June 2016, been trading for 3 years at time of article
- Eight years of initial study (self taught)
- Non-mathematical background, studied literature, worked as a freelance journalist

## Trades

- Opened a Fund and Share account with Hargreaves Lansdown
    - so he could trade dollar-denominated American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) of Argentinian companies on the NYSE
- Also ported a dormant pension into a Self Invested Personal Pension (SIPP)
    - Started trading on SIPP just before Brexit referendum in June 2016
    - Bought a number of UK stocks impacted by the leave vote
- Acknowledges he amassed excessive trading charges, but believed it allowed him to manage risk
- 80% of portfolio in US dollars

### Initial

- First trade, 10 shares of Pampa Energia, Argentinian energy company
    - Total outlay £194.78 including £11.95 trading charge
- Over the next few months, built fund and share portfolio exclusively from Argentine stocks
    - small orders from £135 to £180
    - as stock prices started rising, topped up with £100 to £500 orders
    - eventually committed a total of £7,500
- Sold Argentina portfolio in early 2018, *"sensing the end of a boom cycle"*
    - Pampa Energia, (+189 per cent)
    - Telecom Argentina, (+187 per cent)
    - Empresa Distribuidora y Comercializadora Norte (+276 per cent)
    - some mistimed bank stock losses (-12 per cent)

**Averaged out as £8,000 gain over 20 months on a £7,500 investment.**

Redeployed the gains and original capital on to the next macro bet.

### Losses

> I'd never again invest in a company whose revenue is tied to a quest rather than a concrete product or service.

- Bought shares too high
- Half original investment wiped out
- Gold mining company; started having problems striking gold soon after share purchase
    - £450 loss
- Biopharmaceutical; research phase for a medical patent kept having to be extended
    - £250 loss

## Investment Approach

> Strategy is deciding what you're not going to do.

- Looks for a compelling story, dig into the details behind it, then execute on that knowledge
    - he uses the phrase *"find its magic essence, then capitalise on it"*
- Key part is learning timing; when to take risks, and when to avoid them
- Makes lot of small low risk trades
- Started with a dummy trading account on a simulator for three months
    - trialed different investment strategies
    - noted gains and losses
    - learnt to match news articles to stock pricing
- Worked out for himself what his investment style would be
    - stresses to clearly defined strategy / philosophy and stick to it

### Example Strategies

- Look for growth stocks
- Be macro driven
- Look for special situations
- Low volatility portfolio
- Identify long-term structural winners to hold for many years

Not advisable to do all of them.

### Core trading strategy

- Build portfolios of stocks tagged to a country or region for 12-24 months
    - exit the positions when you believe they have peaked
- Trade based on news articles or surprise earnings call
    - e.g. buying in and out of Tesla over 2 weeks, after volatility in price triggered by Elon Musk tweeting
- Doesn't trade
    - cryptocurrency
    - fixed income
    - currency
    - commodities
    - options
    - futures
    - funds

### Research

- Bases a lot of his global macro investing strategy on reading travel guides
    - uses them to see what people have, need and use, on an everyday basis
- To research Chinese economy, goes to London's Chinatown
    - studies shoes, phones, shopping bags, clothing, watches and handbag logos of Chinese tourists
- On holiday
    - notes which supermarkets are well run
    - which banks have smiling staff
    - which makes of cars are in the majority on the roads
    - talks to taxi drivers about their view on the local economy
- To better understand South Korean companies, took a 3 month Korean language course
- Plans to learn Mandarin next

Can you learn enough nuance and familiarity with a language in 3 months to understand business and markets?

## Conclusion

A lot of the article seems like it was written to convince people to follow his choices:
- *kind of financial stability that journalism had never been able to offer me*
- *trade on my smartphone, walking my dog, whilst on holiday*
- buzz word heavy; *"start-ups", "cloud and serverless computing", "mobile-first"*
- *people like me, previously shut out of investing*

Lots of emotive terms used:
- *ended up falling in love with the stock market*
- *finding its magic essence*
- *clicking the deal button was both exhilarating and terrifying*
- *went on a shopping spree*
- *rushing for this newly opened door*
- *I trade companies and countries because I love a great story*
